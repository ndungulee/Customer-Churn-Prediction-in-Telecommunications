# Customer-Churn-Prediction-in-Telecommunications
## Introduction
Customer churn remains a significant concern for businesses operating in the highly competitive telecommunications industry. Anticipating customer behavior and accurately predicting churn are crucial aspects of customer retention strategies aimed at reducing attrition. Predictive analytics and machine learning play vital roles in identifying churn risks and implementing focused retention efforts.

## Business Understanding
Syriatel, a major telecommunications company, is grappling with customer churn issues. Churn, the rate at which subscribers cancel their subscriptions or switch to competitors, directly impacts the company's revenue and long-term viability. Recognizing the importance of accurately predicting customer attrition and taking proactive steps to retain valuable clients, Syriatel seeks to leverage predictive modeling and advanced analytics to reduce churn rates and maximize retention strategies.

Stakeholders involved in this project include:

Syriatel Management: Directly involved in reducing customer churn rates to maintain market share, increase revenue, and enhance long-term viability.
Marketing Department: Responsible for implementing customer retention strategies based on insights from predictive models.
Customer Service Department: Plays a crucial role in identifying churn risks early and providing proactive support to potentially churned customers.
Data Scientist: Responsible for developing, implementing, and maintaining predictive models, collaborating with other departments to understand business requirements, preprocess data, build models, and provide actionable insights.
The objectives of this project are:

Churn Prediction: Develop accurate predictive models to identify customers at risk of churning using machine learning algorithms such as logistic regression and random forest classifiers.
Retention Strategies: Utilize insights from predictive models to design targeted retention initiatives aimed at reducing churn rates and retaining valuable customers.
Enhanced Customer Experience: Improve overall customer satisfaction by addressing potential churn risks proactively and providing personalized services based on predictive analytics.
Business Growth: Maintain market share, increase revenue, and ensure long-term sustainability by effectively managing customer churn and fostering customer loyalty.
## Problem Statement
The problem addressed in this project is customer churn within Syriatel, impacting revenue, market share, and the company's long-term sustainability. The main goal is to develop a robust predictive model capable of identifying customers likely to churn, enabling Syriatel to implement proactive retention initiatives and reduce churn rates effectively.

## Data Understanding
The SyriaTel dataset serves as the primary source of data for this project, capturing customer interactions, usage patterns, and churn-related information. Data collection involves acquiring the necessary authorizations or credentials from SyriaTel, accessing the data, and understanding its source, distinctive features, and potential limitations.

## Data Preparation
Data cleaning involves handling missing values and converting categorical variables into numerical format. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) helps gain insights, identify patterns, and understand factors influencing customer churn. Data visualization techniques such as pie charts, histograms, and boxplots provide visual representations of churn distribution and feature distributions.

## Model Development
Three machine learning models are developed and evaluated:

Logistic Regression
Decision Trees
Random Forest
Model evaluation includes metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix to assess model performance in predicting churn.

## Hyperparameter Tuning
Grid search cross-validation is performed to fine-tune model hyperparameters and optimize model performance. The best hyperparameters are selected based on the performance metric (accuracy) evaluated during the grid search process.

## Conclusion
In conclusion, this project aims to address the challenge of customer churn in the telecommunications industry by leveraging data-driven insights and predictive modeling. By developing accurate churn prediction models, Syriatel can reduce churn risks, maximize customer retention efforts, improve customer satisfaction, and maintain a competitive advantage in the market.
